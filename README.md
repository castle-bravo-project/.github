# Castle Bravo Project

## Empowering Legal Defense with Digital Evidence Expertise




At Castle Bravo Project, our core mission is to arm legal defense counsel with the information and tools necessary to meaningfully challenge digital evidence, rapidly identify critical issues, and effectively understand and communicate complex technical information. We address a significant gap in knowledge within the justice community by providing accessible, privacy-focused tools and processes to ingest, assess, and analyze large amounts of complex data.

Our approach is distinguished by our commitment to open-source development, democratizing digital evidence assessment capabilities. We are keenly interested in supporting the interest of justice over profit, firmly believing that insight and transparency in the legal tooling space should be fundamental to developers and requirements owners, demanded by the public, and required by law.




## Our Target Audience

Our primary users are legal professionals, with a keen focus on defense teams. We aim to equip them with the necessary resources to navigate the complexities of digital evidence in both criminal and civil defense cases.




## Our Story

Castle Bravo Project was initiated after discovering a significant knowledge gap within the justice community regarding digital evidence. Our goal is to positively impact this problem by providing defense teams with the tools and knowledge to effectively navigate digital evidence, gain powerful insights, and apply that knowledge with confidence. We are a small team of engineering and technology professionals, united by a shared focus on implementing impactful solutions to complex technical legal challenges.




## Our Current Offerings

Our suite of tools is designed to provide comprehensive support for digital evidence assessment and compliance. While currently at Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage, these tools are poised for growth with the right sponsorship to scale and positively impact a critical and underserved space.

### Flagship Products:

*   **ProofStack**: Provides a structured process to evaluate the admissibility of digital evidence in a legal setting, based on established U.S. legal standards. This is crucial for assessing compliance.
*   **Ignition**: An enterprise compliance management platform with AI-powered automation. Ignition demonstrates compliance, complementing ProofStack's assessment capabilities, specifically in digital evidence admissibility compliance.

### Other Key Tools:

*   **Net-Check**: A tool for network security analysis.
*   **File-Hash-Analyzer**: Quickly analyzes files to determine common hash values and generates reports.

These tools work synergistically to provide a robust framework for legal defense teams.
